Executive KPI & Business Health Dashboard

Project Overview
This project presents an Executive KPI & Business Health Dashboard designed to give senior stakeholders a quick, high-level view of overall business performance.
The dashboard focuses on revenue, customer health, churn risk, and subscription performance, enabling fast, informed decision-making.
Unlike exploratory dashboards, this dashboard prioritizes clarity, hierarchy, and actionability.

Business Objective
The primary goal of this dashboard is to answer one core executive question:
“Is the business healthy right now?”

The dashboard helps executives:
	•	Monitor revenue performance over time
	•	Understand customer activity and churn risk
	•	Identify which subscription plans drive the most revenue
	•	Detect early warning signs related to customer retention

Key KPIs Tracked
The dashboard focuses on a small set of executive-grade metrics:
	•	Total Revenue – Overall revenue generated in the selected period
	•	Active Customers – Number of currently active customers
	•	Churn Rate (%) – Percentage of customers lost, highlighting retention risk
	•	Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) – Revenue generated per customer
	•	Active Customer Percentage (%) – Overall customer base health indicator
Each KPI is intentionally chosen to balance growth, risk, and stability.

Visual Components

The dashboard includes the following visual sections:
	•	Revenue Trend Over Time
Displays revenue movement across time to identify growth or decline patterns.
	•	Revenue by Subscription Plan
Highlights which plans (Premium, Standard, Basic) contribute most to total revenue.
	•	Active Customer Percentage KPI
Replaces traditional donut charts to provide a clearer, more executive-friendly view of customer health.
	•	Executive Insight Narrative
A dynamic insight summarizing revenue drivers and churn risk in one sentence for quick interpretation.

Key Business Insights
Some insights derived from the dashboard include:
	•	Revenue is primarily driven by Premium subscriptions, indicating strong value concentration.
	•	Despite 77.5% active customers, a 22.5% churn rate signals potential retention risk.
	•	Revenue remains relatively stable over time, but customer churn could impact future growth if not addressed.
	•	Improving retention strategies may have a significant impact on long-term revenue sustainability.

Tools & Technologies Used
	•	Power BI – Dashboard development and visualization
	•	DAX – KPI calculations, churn metrics, dynamic executive insights
	•	Data Modeling – KPI-focused model optimized for executive reporting

Why This Project Matters
This dashboard demonstrates:
	•	Strong understanding of executive reporting requirements
	•	Ability to translate raw data into business-ready insights
	•	Clean KPI hierarchy and decision-focused design
	•	Practical use of DAX for real-world analytics scenarios
It is designed to reflect how dashboards are used in real business environments, not just as a technical exercise.

Next Steps / Enhancements
Possible future improvements could include:
	•	YoY or MoM revenue growth comparisons
	•	Forecasting revenue based on churn trends
	•	Segment-level churn analysis
